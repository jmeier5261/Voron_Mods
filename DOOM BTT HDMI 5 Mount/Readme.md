Supports only the HDMI 5 v1.2

This Mod is based off of the  PITFT50 mount shared in the Doom Discord some time back. The original poster looks to have deleted their account.

I am redistributing the base mount from their mod which is what my mod is based on. This piece is required and can be found in the Base Parts folder.

The mount and backplate were build from scratch to be compatible with this mount to allow existing users to easily replace their older ribbon cable displays without having to modify any parts they already had.
